# Digit-Recognizer-with-Tensorflow
My objective is to accurately detect numbers from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images in this competition. My Digit Recognizer project uses TensorFlow to identify handwritten numbers from a large dataset. For precise predictions, it makes use of a clever function called SoftMax in conjunction with a unique image-reading technology known as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). By converting unprocessed data into a trustworthy probability distribution, this combination guarantees accurate identification.


Handwritten Digit Recognition with TensorFlow

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to accurately recognize handwritten digits from a large dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and leverages the softmax function for multi-class classification.

Objective

The primary goal is to achieve high accuracy in detecting digits from a dataset containing tens of thousands of handwritten images.
